# 💫 About Me:
Hi there! I'm KeerthiVasan 👋<br>I'm a data enthusiast who gets genuinely excited about turning messy datasets into clear, actionable insights. I see myself as a hybrid between a Data Analyst and Data Engineer—I love both the "why" behind the numbers and the "how" of building systems that make data work for you.<br>What I Work With<br>I'm comfortable across the data stack, from extracting and transforming data to visualizing it in ways that actually make sense:<br><br>Languages & Tools: SQL, Python, Excel<br>Visualization: Power BI (building dashboards that people actually want to use)<br>Cloud & Engineering: Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Azure Databricks<br><br>What I've Built<br>I believe in learning by doing, so I've worked on projects that span the full data lifecycle:<br><br>Engineered automated data pipelines using Azure Data Factory and Databricks—because manual processes are so 2015<br>Analyzed real-world datasets with SQL and Python to uncover patterns and trends<br>Designed interactive Power BI dashboards that help teams make faster, smarter decisions<br><br>My Approach<br>I think the best data work happens when you combine technical skills with curiosity. I don't just write queries or build pipelines—I ask questions like "What story is this data trying to tell?" and "How can I make this easier for the next person?"<br>Whether it's building an ETL pipeline that runs like clockwork or creating a dashboard that finally gets stakeholders nodding in meetings, I'm all about making data accessible and useful.<br>Let's Connect!<br>I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and take on new challenges. If you're looking for someone who can bridge the gap between data engineering and analytics—or if you just want to chat about data—feel free to reach out!<br><br>"Data is not just numbers—it's a story waiting to be told."<br><br>Current Status: Actively seeking opportunities to contribute to data-driven teams and continue growing my skills.
